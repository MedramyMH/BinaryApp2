MVP Features Implementation
Core Signal Engine
4 independent signal generators with different indicator counts (26, 16, 8, 16)
Consensus algorithm requiring 3/4 generators agreement for >96% confidence
Real-time signal generation simulation
Configurable confidence threshold (65%-95%)
Trading Dashboard
Live signals feed with confidence scores
Signal history and performance tracking
Platform selection (Olymp Trade, IQ Option, etc.)
Market overview with currency pairs
Advanced Tools (Simplified)
Binary Heat Map - visual market strength overview
Fibonacci Calculator - retracement/extension calculations
Economic Calendar - upcoming market events
Price Screener - filter by signal strength
Spreads Calculator - margin calculations
Technical Implementation
React with TypeScript for frontend
Simulated real-time updates using intervals
Local state management for signals
Responsive design with Shadcn-UI components
Mock data for demonstration purposes
Simplified Approach
Since this is an MVP, weâ€™ll focus on:

Visual representation of the signal generation system
Simulated real-time data updates
Professional trading interface design
Core trading tools functionality
Responsive dashboard layout
The backend Flask integration and actual market data APIs would be implemented in production versions.
